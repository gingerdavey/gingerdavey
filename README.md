# Robbie Davey - Web Developer @ [Limely](https://www.limely.co.uk/), Chester

Graduated from Aberystwyth University in June 2017 with a degree in Computer Science. I then got a job as a junior developer at Bella Design, Knutsford. I worked there for 2 years
before moving into my current position at Limely.

I'm a front-end developer and mainly develop Wordpress sites. With my current role I am also learning to develop Magento sites. In my spare time I am 
trying to develop my skills further by doing the courses on freecodecamp.org and also laracasts. Trying to further my knowledge of languages I use everday,
as well as trying to pick up newer frameworks like React and Vue. I'm also interested in learning Laravel.
